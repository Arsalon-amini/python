#representing numbers (dec, binary, hexidecimal, complex nums)

#binary
x = 10
y = 0b10  #number 2 in binary
z = bin(256)  #takes a number, returns binary representation

#hexidecimal
a = 0x12c #number 300 in hexidecmial system
b = hex(55)  #built in fn -> returns hexidecimal representation 


#complex numbers
c = 1 + 2j #in python 'j' reprseents imaginary number i in mathematics
